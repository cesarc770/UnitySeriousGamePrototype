# Blaze Masters - Unity 2D Serious Game

Blaze Masters is a 2D prototype built with Unity and Web GL in 2.5 weeks with a Team of 5. The purpose of the Game was to teach forest fire facts and better ways to handle.
The game contains 4 buttons:
  ### Plant
  ### Water
  ### Survey 
  ### Cut
  
  One of the facts we learned on our research is that appropiate and isolated fires when controlled can be beneficial to the growth of new trees. In the game when handles properly you cna let one tree born and when planting you will be able to plant 3 instead of one a time. 
  There are also sick trees. Which can help spread fire faster and if not cut down on time can become a problem. 
  
  The Goal of the game is to be able to use this knowledge and manage your representational forest until you are able to achieve a growth of 40 plants total. If you do so you Win and if you let the whole forest burn, you loose.
